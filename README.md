# Hello Build code exercise

Project built with **_ReactJS_** for client app, and **_Express_** for Backend server.

Contains integrations with [Github API v4](https://developer.github.com/v4/object/user/) using **GraphQL**, and [Google Calendar API](https://developer.github.com/v4/object/user/) using OAuth to access their APIs.

## Overview

Create a single page app where a user can Sign Up _(sign up should only write the user into a local storage)_, then Login.\
Login can simply validate credentials against local storage _(use a backend API for bonus points)_.\
Once logged in users should have two sections they can navigate into.

- A Github section, where their repositories are listed _(Oauth will be required to access the API)_
- A Calendar section, where their upcoming calendar events are listed _(Oauth will be required to access the API)_

### Getting started

Frontend: Go to `/client-app` folder and read the instructions on `README.md`

API: Go to `/api` folder and read the instructions on `README.md`
